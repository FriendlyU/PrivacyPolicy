# FriendlyU Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how FriendlyU collects, uses, and shares your information when you join and use our service. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or comments, please contact us at [Support@FriendlyU.com](mailto:support@friendlyu.com).

## Information Collection and Use
**Basic Account Information**: When you create a FriendlyU profile, you provide basic personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Each user may then add as much or as little to their profile as they choose, within the parameters of the User Agreement. You may unsubscribe to emails at any time.

**Connecting**: Our Services are primarily designed to help you connect with other students. Your profile information will be used to help sort search results when finding similar students to connect with. We may use this information to customize ads and other content messages from FriendlyU.

**Links**: FriendlyU may keep track of what interests you have in common as you connect with others. We do this to help improve our Services and to provide more relevant advertising.

**Cookies**: We use cookies to collect additional profile and website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as looking at public user profiles, institutional profiles, and club profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. FriendlyU may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.

**Log Data**: When you use our Services, we may receive information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services; for example, when you visit our websites, sign into your profile, begin a search, or interact with our messaging service. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with a link on our Services to a third-party advertiser.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure
We do not disclose your private personal information except in these circumstances:

**Your Consent**: We may share or disclose your information at your discretion.

**Service Providers**: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.

**Law**: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect FriendlyU’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.

**Business Transfers and Affiliates**: In the event that FriendlyU is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.

**Non-Private Information**: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information on your public user profile.

## Changing your personal Information
If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can also permanently delete your FriendlyU account by contacting our support team.

## Our Policy Towards Underage Children
Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact [support@friendlyu.com](mailto:support@friendlyu.com). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.

## Policy Updates
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at [FriendlyU.com/privacypolicy.php](https://FriendlyU.com/privacypolicy.php). If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will update the [official blog](http://blog.friendlyu.com) and/or email to notify our users. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
